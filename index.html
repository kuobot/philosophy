let quote = [
"I think there are two really important things for all founders, not just first timers: refusal to accept the world as you find it, and the tenacity to keep trying to change it to be better. Fundamentally, this what building a startup boils down to. If you have that, you'll be able to identify problems other people miss, and you won't let anything stop you from fixing those problems.",
"Listening to our early customers even more earlier on -- we wavered a bit too much in the initial years on our strategy, and we could have moved much faster in the first 1.5-2 years.",
"Always focus on the customer! (Some of) our customers knew what we should be doing years before we did, we just had to be listening to the right ones, in the right ways, and build technology in such a way that they would never have thought of, but for the problems that they had thought of.",
"No, never (truthfully). Through a mix of bad grades and boredom, I wasn't a great fit for the college environment -- so dropping out was relatively easy (minus missing my friends). And, the risk of not having a degree if Box didn't work out was mitigated as technically I was on a leave of absence, so I could always go back. Always protect the downside, but don't drive your decisions by it.",
"hang out with great people. say yes to things as much as you can in your early career. I've made so many friends and met so many amazing people by going and speaking at events or going to meetups. Never be afraid to get in touch with someone and ask to meet them for a coffee. You'd be amazed at how easy it is to get really smart, influential people to give you fifteen minutes. Be open - get involved in events and things around your community. If you want an amazing way to build your network, go to a Startup Weekend. You'll meet some incredible people. Go to events that are on near you. Talk to people. Keep talking to the ones that you find inspirational. Send short emails to people you're not connected to but want to meet and ask them for 10 mins. You'll find that building a network is a) good fun and b) easier than you think. Do not send 'i'd like to add you to my professional network....' messages on LinkedIn - that's a surefire way to not succeed or engage with people.",
"if you mean userbase growth, the first thing to nail is do people actually want to use the product and is there a market need? If the answer is 'Yes' due to e.g. organic adoption, the next question is how to scale it. Common tools include: 1. Funnel analysis. Where are you losing users? Do you have a lot of people showing up and you are bad at converting them? Or are you simply not attracting enough people to begin with? These two types of problems have different solutions. 2. What is your sales strategy? In general, as an enterprise or SaaS company you will need to focus on sales and marketing including building out an ISO or direct sales team. An analysis of sales approach can really matter. 3. Where do similar products get distribution? You can often copy or innovate on these approaches. 4. Is there a channel briefly open you can exploit? e.g. Every 2 years there is a new way to bootstrap distribution on Facebook. I think too many companies unfortunately lack basic product/market fit and then try to scale it without a product that works. The second most common mistake is companies with product/market fit not investing in distribution early enough as they are growing fast organically. Google and FB were both hyper aggressive on distribution tactics even early on.",
"Thank you. Be aggressive, don't wait for people to follow you on social media. Go out and find them, follow them and engage with them. Create a platform for yourself (personal website) to market yourself the way you want to and host your music. Regularly schedule posts on social, be active in communities where people share music, partner and work with small music blogs and podcasts to get your name out there. You have to start somewhere. Also optimize your website for SEO and make sure that its a user friendly experience. Also look into building an email list for your supporters. Yes. The strengths were proof of traction, having a product developed in place, lack of vanity metrics, and an authentic passion for what we were doing. The weakness was that we should have had better reasoning for exactly why we needed the money and what we were going to use it for. Not just because you need money or running out of money. A lot better at pitching now.",
"you are not alone! I experienced this same skepticism when I founded Rock Health at 25 with little healthcare experience. A few things can help: (1) Know your weaknesses and assemble a team with the smartest, experienced people who can make up for any deficit. (2) Go above and beyond to validate your concept. Know the ROI, and use that to lead your sales. (3) Partner with existing trusted organizations that can serve as a channel parter. Best of luck!",

"If you could change one decision that you have made in your past regarding @Box , what would it be and how would that change where or what @Box is today?",
"Hey Aaron, thanks for doing this. Big fan of you and your work. What's the best advice you would give to an entrepreneur in college, looking to start a startup.  Also what advice would you give to yourself at age 21.",
"Did you ever regret dropping out of school to start a business? I'd be surprised to hear you regret it today, but in the early days, how often did you think about going back? Was there any moment where you almost did?",
"Hi! What have you found to be the best way to create an important network around you? Is there something that you would earlier in your life regarding that?",
"Hi Elad, thanks for joining us today. What growth tips can you share with us from successfully cofounding your own companies?",
"Hi Everette, What would your advice be to early-stage independent musicians looking to grow their brands through online marketing?  Did you ever have to make a pitch for seed funding? And if so, what were the strengths and weaknesses of your pitch",
"I'm co-founder of a health startup and I've found that being young leads to skepticism that the company can execute and land large clients (I don't think this would be the case if we were a consumer startup). Has that been the case for your portfolio companies at Rock Health and what ways have you helped founders to overcome that initial skepticism?",
